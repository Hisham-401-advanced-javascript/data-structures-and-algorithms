# Code Challenge 1: Reverse An Array

## Problem Domain
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach and Efficiency
Beasley and I started by coming to an understanding of how a binary search works. From there, we established a flexible middle point of a sorted array and chose a while loop to iterate through the array. We eventually figured out how to match the key with the index position in the array.
